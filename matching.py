        A greedy algorithm for minimizing the driver set union via single-step exchanges.

        This method, "CLAP Greedy" (CLAPG), iteratively performs the most straightforward

        symmetric difference of one layer (`D1 \\ D2` or `D2 \\ D1`) and an alternating
        path that leads to a node `v` that is a driver in the *other* layer.
        If such a pair `(u, v)` is found, the matching is updated, which is guaranteed
        to reduce the union size by one. The process repeats until no such single-step
        improvement can be found or `max_steps` is reached.

        Parameters
        ----------
        max_steps : Optional[int], optional

        """
        Finds the exact minimum union size using an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation.

        This method provides a baseline for the exact optimal solution by modeling the
        two-layer maximum matching and driver set union problem as an ILP. It is suitable
        for small to medium-sized graphs.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n_max : int
            A safeguard threshold. The method will raise an error if the number of nodes
            exceeds this value. Defaults to 10000.
        time_limit : Optional[float]
            An optional time limit in seconds for the ILP solver. Defaults to None.
        prefer : {"ortools", "pulp", "auto"}
            The preferred ILP solver backend. "ortools" is generally faster.
            Defaults to "ortools".
        budget_mode : {"fixed", "at_most", "auto"}
            - "fixed": Enforces that the size of each driver set `|D_l|` must equal `k_l`.
            - "at_most": Enforces `|D_l| <= k_l`.
            - "auto": A two-stage optimization that first finds the minimum possible
              driver set sizes (`k1*`, `k2*`) and then minimizes the union size
              subject to these fixed budgets. This corresponds to finding the
              absolute minimum union over all possible maximum matchings.
        k1, k2 : Optional[int]
            The budget for each layer's driver set size. Used only when `budget_mode`
            is "fixed" or "at_most". If None, the size of the current driver set is used.
        tighten_union : bool
            Whether to add redundant constraints to tighten the linear relaxation,
            which can improve solver performance. Defaults to True.

        Returns
        -------
        int
            The exact minimum size of the union `|D1 U D2|`.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the graph is too large or `budget_mode` is unknown.
        RuntimeError
            If the ILP solver fails or is not installed.

        Finds the exact minimum union size using a Matroid Intersection algorithm.

        This method implements a theoretically grounded, exact algorithm based on the
        intersection of two transversal matroids. The problem of minimizing `|D1 U D2|`
        is equivalent to maximizing `|X1 ∩ X2|`, where `X1` and `X2` are the sets of
        matched nodes (bases of the transversal matroids `M1` and `M2`). The algorithm finds
        the largest common independent set `S*` of `M1` and `M2`, then extends `S*` to
        bases `X1` and `X2` of `M1` and `M2` respectively. The final driver sets are
        `D1 = V \\ X1` and `D2 = V \\ X2`.
